            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                the
                objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                        communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                        and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                        to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and
                        page navigation.</p>

            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. </p>

            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                        subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                        letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a"
                        through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as 책 and 체 in identifiers. You can also
                        use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal
                        names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
